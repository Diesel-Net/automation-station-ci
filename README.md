# automation-station-ci
Automation Station Continuous Integration. This repository contains the Ansible and Drone configuration necessary for automatic weekly builds of [Automation Station](https://www.automationstationgame.com/).

A big shoutout to the Devs working on [Game-CI](https://game.ci/) making this CI/CD pipeline possible.

Unity + Docker + Linux = :heart:
